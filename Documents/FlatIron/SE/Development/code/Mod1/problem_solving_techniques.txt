What are three things that stand out?

"Be prepared to answer the question, What have you tried?" 
No one is an all knowing font of knowledge. You have to show you ran out of ideas and that 
your intention in asking for help is to possibly get more ideas to try. An answer comes 
from testing and tests come from ideas.

"The problem is that this person's problem-solving technique is to ask for the solution." 
If asking for the solution is your main problem-solving technique then you will always 
be dependant on someone else to be knowledgable in the area you are trying to explore.
If you provide someone who is fully dependant on you for an answer with the answer, the 
next question will likely be how to use that answer. After that, anything related to that 
answer will require you as a dependancy because there is a lack of understanding.
 
"Here's a secret: willingness and desire to learn are the true qualifications. 
Not ability;" 
Learning to learn has exponential value compared to the linear value of memorizing a 
specific fact.. and knowledge is useless without action. Action in programming is likely 
to result in error, that doesn't mean you've fail, it just means you've moved your 
understanding one step forward.
