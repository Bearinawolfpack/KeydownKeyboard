What are the two types of associations/relationships that we discussed yesterday? 

One to Many 
require_related (run file)


How do we build that relationship into our code? 

One to Many says that one class (owner) has many relationships (toys) and that 
each of those instances know their one owner upon initialization that way the owner does not need. 

Require_related seperates files that hold classes and is a seperate file that 
classes are linked to that way classes can be added in the future and be easily 
debugged.


Which model holds the reference in a has many/belongs to association? Why?

I'm not sure exactly what this is asking but I believe it's that one instance 
knows it's owner upon initialization but the owner does not track each of it's 
peers. This also enables a single-source or truth in that @@all will be able 
to track each peer instance per peer class and the owner can reference that 
source.
