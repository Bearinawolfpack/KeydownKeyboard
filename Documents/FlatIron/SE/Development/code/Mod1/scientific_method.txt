How does this relate to Programming?

Programming is about experimenting or performing tests to prove a hypothesis.
It's important that we don't assume that everything will work exactly how we 
expect it to as that is likely how to problem can or will occur.


Why is it important for a Developer to master the Scientific Method?

It ensures that every piece you are using trying to solve a puzzle is 
doing exactly what you expect it to. In other words, having a process
prevents assumptions used in coming up with an expected result (hypothesis). 


Which step(s) of the method should you work on alone?

Test with an experiment / Troubleshoot procedure, carefully checking
all steps and set-up.


Which step(s) of the method should you work on with a peer/colleague?

If I cannot come up with a means to troubleshoort a procedure, I would
ask a colleague what they would do.


Which step(s) of the method should you ask an instructor for help?

If I cannot find a means of troubleshooting anywhere else, I'd ask an 
instructor how I could come up with a test. I'd also ask an instructor if 
my results do not align with my Hypothesis. I might need to think about the 
problem differently.
